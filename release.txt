The release has been created. It is up to you to check if the release is up
to par, and perform the following commands yourself when you start the vote
to enable future development during the vote and after.

A vote email has been generated in release-vote.txt, you can copy/paste it using:

    cat release-vote.txt | pbcopy

You can find the distribution in target/dist.


Failed release
--------------

To rollback a release due to a failed vote or some other complication use:

    $ ./revert-7.3.0.sh

This will clean up the artfifacts from the staging areas, including Nexus,
dist.apache.org and the release branch and tag.


Successful release
------------------

Congratulations on the successful release vote!

Use the release-announce.txt as a starter for the release announcement:

    cat release-announce.txt | pbcopy

To promote the release after a successful vote, run:

    $ ./promote-7.3.0.sh

This will promote the Nexus staging repository to Maven Central, and move
the release artifacts from the staging area to dist.apache.org. It will
also sign the release tag and push the release branch to git.apache.org

You can read this message at a later time using:

    $ cat release.txt

Happy voting!
